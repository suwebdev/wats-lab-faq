This FAQ answers the question "How to create a Digital Ocean droplet and provide SSH connection to Github?"

# Overall Process

Providing an SSH Connection to Github can be done either before or after creating the Digital Ocean \(DO\) droplet.  It turns out that it's easier to set up an SSH key in DO before creating the droplet than to manually add the SSH key to the DO droplet after creating it.  For that reason, I'll describe setting up the SSH Connection before describing setting up the droplet.

# Provide SSH Connection to Github

### Setup SSH Keys for the Account

Because the application that runs to setup a droplet prompts the user for an existing SSH key \(or keys\), it makes sense to set these keys up before attempting to create the droplet.
