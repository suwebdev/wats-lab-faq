# Create gh-pages branch for Github hosting

Github will host the web pages that you create in your Repos.  One way to set up Github hosting is to create a gh-pages branch in your repo.  Any code in that branch will be hosted at an address that follows this pattern 

https://&lt;account name&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo name&gt;

For example if my account name is `janeblow` and my repo name is `wats3010-hello-world` , and I have created a gh-pages branch on my repo, I will find the index.html located in the root of the repo served up at this URL:

`https://janeblow.github.io/wats3010-hello-world`

If you have created a gh-pages branch, but are unsure where it is hosted you can click on the Settings tab on the main page of your repo and then scroll down to find the link to the hosted web pages.
