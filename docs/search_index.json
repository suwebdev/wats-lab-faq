create an account on Github at https://github.com/.\nDownload and Install Git\nhttps://git-scm.com/downloads\nThis will install a Folder with a number of file and programs.\nOpen a bash window (terminal on Mac or 'git bash' on Windows) and type in\ngit --version\nThis should return a confirmation that git is installed with a version number.\nConnect to your local workstation to Github with SSH\nWithout SSH connection setup you will have to enter your username and password every time you connect to Github, which you will usually have to do during a git push  command.  By sharing your workstation public key with Github, you will not have to provided username and password to connect.\nOpen a bash session (terminal on Mac or 'git bash' on Windows).  All commands below should be entered into the bash session.\nCheck to see if you already have a private key/public key setup by listing any files in the hidden direction .ssh.\nls -al ~/.ssh\nIf you don't see any of the following files you will need to create  the key files\n\nid_rsa.pub\nid_ecdsa.pub\nid_ed25519.pub\n\nCreate public key/private key files if they don't already exist\nYou only need to do this step if you don't already have public/private key files.\nYou ll first create the key files using the email you provided to Github.  This will label the keys with that  email.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nNext you'll be prompted to enter a file name for your keys and you can just press enter to accept the default.\nEnter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]\nFinally, you'll be prompted to enter a passphrase.  This is a security feature and you will have to enter this passphrase when you connect to Github, so be sure to remember it.  It can be as simple as a four digit pin number.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\nEnter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\nStart SSH Agent and Add Keys\nThe SSH Agent is a process that will allow you to manage SSH Keys.  You'll start that process and add your keys with the following command.\neval $(ssh-agent -s)\nYou will see a response like this indicate that the process is running.\nAgent pid 59566\nThe command below adds your key to the ssh agent.  If the name of your key is different replace id_rsa with the name of your key.\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nAdd the SSH Key to you Github Acccount\nNow you need to add the public key to your Github account.  This will allow Github to decrypt the data you send it via SSH.\nWe start by using the clip command to copy the content of the public key SSH file to your local buffer.\nclip \nIf the clip command is not installed you can list the file to the console and then copy the contents into your buffer with ctrl-c/cmd-c.  The cat command will list the file to the console.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nYou can also open the file with a text editor and copy the content into the buffer if you have trouble with the clip command.\nNext, go to your Github account online and click on your photo.  This will reveal a dropdown selection where you should select Settings.\n\nThe Setings menu will appear on the left of the screen and from there you will click on SSH and GPG keys.\n\nAfter you click on SSH and GPG keys you, you will you click on a button to add a new key.\n\nClick on the Green button to add the key you have in you buffer.  You should see a form. Enter a Title that help you to remember the workstation you got the key from and then paste the key into the key textarea.  Finally click on the Add SSH key to add it to the list of keys known to Github.\n\nUpdate User Name and Email in Local Git Config\nThe local Git program maintains configuration data about you that should correspond to your account on github.com.

If you ever forget to close the quotes when adding the message during commit (git commit -m\"update) you find that git open up the default editor.\nBefore running the git config to set VS Code as the default editor, check that the application is in your computer's path so that it can be found.  You can check this by going to the command line and running.\ncode --help\nIf a list of help topic is printed to the screen, the VS Code is in the path.

If in the path execute the following in the command line.\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\ntest with this: git config --global -e\nIf you set up, the command above will open the .gitconfig file which is where git stores its config variable in VS Code.\nSee the answer to a question about this on Stack Overflow for more information: Editor For Git]\nHow to Use Visual Studio Code as Default Editor For Git\nAdding VS Code to your computer Path\nMac: Select\n\nMac: Shell Command: Install 'Code' command in path\nfrom the Command Palette.\nWindows: Make sure you selected\nAdd to PATH\nduring the installation.\nLinux: Make sure you installed Code via our new .deb or .rpm packages.\n\nAdditional References\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/\n"},"second-question.html":{"url":"second-question.html","title":"Setup Dev environment with Visual Studio Code","keywords":"","body":"This is the answer to \"How to set up Dev environment with Visual Studio Code?\".\nInstall Visual Studio Code\nDownload and install VS Code using the link below.\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/\nPlugins\nPlugins provide additional functionality.\nLive-Server plugin\nLive-Server will serve up web pages from your VS Code project to your default browser.  It runs an HTTP server as a background process on the 5500 port, which is a development port.\nTo install:\nClick on the Extensions icon located at the bottom of the left nav bar in the VS Code Application.\n\nSearch for 'Live-Server' and click on the Green Install button.\n\nAfter the Extension is loaded, click on the Blue Reload button to complete the installation.\n\nNow you should see a Go Live button in the bottom status bar.  When you click on that, Live-Server will start and serve your index.html  file by default.\nOnce the server has been started, the Go Live button will change to Port: 5500 which indicates that the server is running. The Go Live and Port:5500 buttons operate as a toggle. When you save changes in files that are being served, the server will automatically reserve the files. This will ensure that your browser is always running the latest saved changes.\n\nBeautify Plugin\nThe Beautify Plug in will help with code formatting.  It will allow you to right-click on a document that you are editing and see a \"Format Document\" option.  Clicking on this will format your page.

VS Code provides a GUI settings manager by default. To modify default settings by upgrading JSON configuration directly use the open command (CTRL-Shift-P on Windows or CMD-Shift-P on Mac) and type in \"Open Settins (JSON)\".   \n \nYou will see 2 files side by side.  On the left are the default settings and on the right are the User setting overrides.\n\nTo change a default setting find the setting on the left and then copy it to the right with your desired setting.  For example, if you don't want to see the minimap on the right hand side of the application, you can make the following entry in the file on the right. Notice that options are key : value pairs and that they are commas separated.\n{\n\"editor.minimap.enabled\":false\n}\nIf you are using Windows and want to use \"Git Bash\" in for the VS Code terminal add the following to your User Settings:\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\"\nHow to Easily Add VS Code to the Mac PATH\nIt is often handy to be able to open VS Code from the command line.  In order to do this the \"code\" command which is the name of the VS Code program must be in the machine's list of programs which are stored in the environmental PATH variable. It will get installed in the windows PATH during Windows install.

One way to set up Github hosting is to create a gh-pages branch in your repo.  Any code in that branch will be hosted at an address that follows this pattern\nhttps://.github.io/\nFor example if my account name is janedev and my repo name is wats3010-hello-world , and I have created a gh-pages branch on my repo, I will find the index.html located in the root of the repo served up at this URL:\nhttps://janedev.github.io/wats3010-hello-world\nIf you have created a gh-pages branch, but are unsure where it is hosted you can click on the Settings tab on the main page of your repo and then scroll down to find the link to the hosted web pages.\n\nCommands to create gh-pages\nWhen you start working on a new repo you will be in the master branch.\nFrom a bash terminal (git bash on Window or terminal on Mac)\nCheck which branch you're in\ngit status\nIf you are in master and you want to create a gh-pages branch on Github enter the following commands.\nFirst push all your work to master.

The format is local:remote.\ngit push -u origin gh-pages:gh-pages\nCommands to continue work on gh-pages branch\nIf you are returning to work on code in a repo that you have worked on before, you will not need to run checkout -b because you don't want to create a new branch, you just want to access the existing branch.  Start with getting status.\ngit status\nIf the status indicates that you are already on gh-pages, you don't have to do anything.  If you're on master, you can checkout gh-pages.

An SSH connection allows you to connects one node(machine) in a network to another without have to to enter a password.   The relationship between the two machines will follow a client server model.  The machine on which you type \"ssh @client (aka \"local machine\") an the machine that you are trying to connect to is the server (aka \"host machine\").  The server always maintains the information about the username and password.   A machine may act as either client or server depending on whether the user is logged on to it or trying to connect ot it: if the user is already logged on to it, it is the client.\nIn order for a client to connect to a server using SSH, it must set up a  public key/private key pair.  The public key and private key provide the encryption needed for secure authentication and authorization.  An algorithm can verify that a give private key matches a given public key.  Both the public and private keys are stored on the client.  Before the client can connect to the server, the server must record the public key of the client in an file called authorized_keys located in the .ssh directory under the home directory of the user on the server machine.  When the user issues the SSH command from the client machine the public key (and proof that it has the matching private key) is sent to the server.  If there is a match between the public key sent to the server and one of the keys in the authorized_keys file, then a test is made on the client to see if the server is trusted. During ssh initialization the host send the client a host key.  The client checks the host key against entries in the known_hosts file.  If the host key is not found a message pops up asking the user to verify the host.  Once verified the host key is added to the client's known_hosts file.\nFor example if I want to issue the following command:  ssh bob@1.2.3.4, the following setup must exist on the the client and server machines.\n\nYou can think of authorized_keys as a file that helps the server trust the client and known_hosts as a  file that helps the client trust the server.  The public key, authorized_keys and known_hosts files are all text files and the contents may be safely copy and pasted.  It is also possible to add a config file to the client .ssh directory and the config file can be used to map servers to different public/private key files if needed.  In general, SSH will look in the .ssh directory and try all keys if needed when attempted to authenticate.\nA machine may contain both and authorized_keys file and a known_hosts  file because it can be operating in the either role at different times.\n \nSetting up SSH on a Mac or Linux Client\nCheck to see if key files already exist because you don't want to replace them if they might already be in use.\nls -la ~/.ssh/\nLook for id_rsa_ _and id_rsa.pub\nGenerate the key files\nssh-keygen\nCheck that the key files have been properly generated\nls -la ~/.ssh/\nCopy the public key to the buffer\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nSelect contents of file from screen and CTRL-c to put in buffer\nUse a text editor and paste the key into the authorized_keys file on the server you wish to access.\nSetting up SSH on a Windows Client\nIf you are using Windows 10, you have 3 options for creating the public/private key needed for SSH and running SSH.\n\nUse git bash to create keys and run SSH. When you download git to you windows machine, you will get the git bash program which will provide a bash interface.  See this article on github.com: https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/.\nUse puTTYgen to create the public and private keys.  Use puTTY to create an SSH Session from a GUI.  See this youtube video for an example of how to use puTTY to connect to a server.\nInstall a linux shell on your Windows 10 machine. This will create a new file system, so you need to keep this in mind if you're developing on the Windows file system.

See this website, permissions-calculator, to see how changing the octal value changes the value of the read, write, execute properties.\nThe chmod command allows you to change the permissions on an object.  If I want to enable all permission on a object I could issue the command chmod 777 .

For example, if you find you still can't install with the directed chmod command above, you can navigate to the directory above the server root and then set all files and directories under the server root to allow the user to write with the following commands:\ncd /var/www\nchmod -R 775 html\nWhen adding permissions to any application, such as Wordpress, you alway want to give just enough but not to much access.

You only execute the command that start with git below.\n# optional check to see the file you have changed they will appear in red\ngit status\n# add the file to the local git repo - you can name each file or use . to specify all files below current\n# directory\ngit add .\n# if you issue git status now the files added will be green\n# commit the files to the directory and provide a message describing the changes\ngit commit -m\"my changes for this commit\"\n# if you issue git status now you'll see a notice that you have files to push\n# push the files to github.com repo\ngit push origin master\nYou might want to commit to memory\ngit add .\ngit commit -m\"my changes\"\ngit push origin master\nDefault Editor for Git\nIf you forget to enter a message for your commit, you'll find that an editor will open.  This default editor is VIM which may be unfamiliar to you.  For that reason, it a good idea to configure an editor you're familiar with, which would be Visual Studio Code. You only need to do this once.\nTo configure Visual studio code, make sure that you have this program in your path.  You can test this.\ncode --help\nwhich should show you help output.  If it's not in the path you can add it to the path\nMac Install Code in Path\nIn VS Code enter CTRL-SHIFT-P to open the Command Pallete and type in Shell Command: Install 'Code' Command in command path\nWindows Install Code in Path\nYou can check a box during installation to add Code to Windows path. If you didn't do this you can rerun the installation.\n\nSet VS Code as the default editor for Git\nOnce you've verified that VS code is in the path, you can execute the following command to make it the default editor for Git.\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\nYou can test that VS Code is your default editor for git by typing the following command.  This will open your machine's ~/.gitconfig file in VS Code.  This is a hidden file under your user root that contains all the git configuration settings.\ngit config --global -e\n"},"create-a-droplet-on-digital-ocean.html":{"url":"create-a-droplet-on-digital-ocean.html","title":"Create a Droplet on Digital Ocean","keywords":"","body":"This FAQ answers the question \"How to create a Digital Ocean droplet and provide SSH connection to Github?\"\nOverall Process\nProviding an SSH Connection to Github can be done either before or after creating the Digital Ocean (DO) droplet.  It turns out that it's easier to set up an SSH key in DO before creating the droplet than to manually add the SSH key to the DO droplet after creating it.  For that reason, I'll describe setting up the SSH Connection before describing setting up the droplet.\nProvide SSH Connection to Github\nSetup SSH Keys for the Account\nBecause the application that runs to setup a droplet prompts the user for an existing SSH key (or keys), it makes sense to set these keys up before attempting to create the droplet.\n\nStart by creating SSH Keys on you local machine (See the FAQ on Install Git Locally)\nCopy the public  SSH Key into your buffer cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and select and copy.\nOpen Digital Ocean in your browser and navigate to Account | Security.  Then use the Add SSH Key form to add the public key to Digital Ocean.\n\nThe net effect of having an SSH Key uploaded to you DO account is that you will see it offered up when you are creating your droplet.\nUpload SSH Keys to Digital Ocean Account\nHow to Add SSH Keys\nHow to Add an SSH Key Manually to an Existing Droplet\nIf you already have a droplet and you want to add an SSH key, you will need to do it manually.\n\nOn you local machine copy the key into the buffer cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and select and copy.\nLaunch the console from Digital Ocean dashboard and login using your DO login credentials.\nUse ls -la ~/.ssh/authorized_keysto determine of the authorized keys files exists.  If it doesn't create it with touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nUse nano to edit the authorized_keys file (nano has copy/paste) and paste the SSH key from your local machine into the authorized keys file and save.\nSet permissions on the authorized_keys file to make it accessible   \n\nchmod -R go= ~/.ssh\nchown -R $USER:$USER ~/.ssh\n\n\n[Upload keys on an existing droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/to-existing-droplet\nCreate a Digital Ocean Droplet\nFollow the step for creating a droplet in the link below.  Choose an Ubuntu images/1 GB memory/25 GB disk/San Francisco for your data center as it's the closest to Seattle.  You want the simplest images for your server as possible and it should only cost $5/month.  You don't need a back up or block storage.  If you uploaded an SSH key you should see it available when under \"Add SSH key\" and you should select it.    Then just click on create.  If you make a mistake just delete the image from the console and try it again.  Don't get attached to your server, especially when there's nothing on it.  Make note of the IP Address.\nOnce the image it created, go to your local machine and login using ssh.  Here's an example if your IP address is  203.0.113.0\nssh root@203.0.113.0\nIf your using a Mac you can do this from the terminal and if you're using Windows, I recommend doing it from Git Bash.\nCreate droplet\nConnect with SSH\n"},"migrate-vue-2-code-from-vue-cli-2-to-vue-cli-3.html":{"url":"migrate-vue-2-code-from-vue-cli-2-to-vue-cli-3.html","title":"Migrate Vue 2 Code from Vue CLI 2 to Vue CLI 3","keywords":"","body":"This FAQ answers the question \"How to migrate Vue 2 code from Vue CLI 2 to Vue CLI 3?\"\nMigrate Vue 2 Code From Vue CLI 2 to Vue CLI 3\nVue.js has rearchitected the way that you build the Vue.js 2 code.  It's important to discern the difference between the way that you code Vue.js and the way that you build Vue.js.  Vue.js released an new version of the CLI (the command line interface for building Vue.js code in to Vanilla JavaScript and CSS) in 2017.  The versioning moved from 2 to 3.\nIt is not necessary to upgrade the Vue.js 2 code, but if you want to continue to develop in Vue.js you should upgrade the CLI to version 3.  There are a number of important architecture changes to the way that a project is configured and architected in CLI 3.  It is not necessary to modify your code to make this move.  The changes required involved moving new configuration files and changes to the file structure (where your code is stored).\nThis document outlines a process to migrate your code repo and add new config files so that it can take advantage of the CLI 3.\nUpgrade Node\nThe first step should be to make sure you're using the latest version of node and npm.  This can be done by executing the global install command. This command will update node and npm.\nnpm install -g node\nIf you're on a Mac, depending on how you installed node, you made need to use the sudo command for permission to do this upgrade.\nsudo npm install -g node\nIts always a good idea to check your upgrade by checking versions.\nnpm --version\nnode --version\nUpgrade Vue CLI\nTo upgrade Vue CLI you can follow instructions on this page: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html\nIf you have Vue 2 CLI installed you need to uninstall it.\nnpm uninstall vue-cli -g\nThe command to install CLI 3 is\nnpm install -g @vue/cli\nThen verify the version\nvue --version\nAs of this writing, the current version is 3.3.0, but there is a lot of development taking place with Vue.js and this may not be the version that you get.  Your major version (the first number should at least be a 3).\nBuild and Dev\nCLI 3 provides a production and dev build just as CLI 2 did but the command to run the dev build and server has changed. To run the dev build use the following command:\nnpm run serve\nTo run the production build, which should create runnable html/css/js in the docs directory:\nnpm run build\nMigrate Code\nBranch Existing Code\nDo the migrate on a branch and then when it's working properly, merge to the Master branch.  For example (below), create a branch named cli3 and check it out to your local machine to work on.\ngit checkout -b cli3\nThe new file structure that CLI 3 is looking for is shown in the picture below.  Your goal will be to migrate your file structure to this new structure.  Notice that the config and build directories are gone.  The node_modules is listed in .gitignore so it the name appears faded out in VS Code. There are some new .js files used for configuration.\n\nThe changes to look for in this picture are:\n\nthe router code is in a router.js file in the root instead of router/index.js\nthere is a new views directory - in CLI 3 the best practice is to put components referenced in the router into the views directory and use the components directory for non-view components\nthere is a .gitkeep file in the components directory and the views directory\nthere some new config files - this document will provide the contents for these files, in particular .babel.config.js, postcssrc.js\nthere a couple of config files that I created specifically to make migration easier to put production build code in the docs directory that you'll add aliases.config.js and vue.config.js\nthe package.json library dependencies has changed significantly and you'll want to replace the entire content of package.json with code provided in this document\nthe static folder has been renamed to public and the index.html has moved into the public folder\n\nNOTE: It's possible that the config code provided in this document may change. You can always generate the lates config code by running the new project create command to create a new project that will have all of the latest config code.  The project create command will not create the vue.config.js or the aliases.config.js as those are user created and I created them to allow for the use of the @ symbol to specify src and to make the build create distributable files in the docs folder so that we can host on github.io.\nTo create a new project in Vue CLI 3 you can run the command below which will create a project called hello-world. Notice that the keyword has changed froom init to create. You should also pick the default babel/eslint.\nvue create hello-world\nSee this page for instructions on creating a new project and note special instructions for Windows users that are using the git bash terminal: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create.\nThe purposed of these migration instructions is that you shouldn't have to create a new project - you should be able to migrate the code by just adding config files and modifying the file structure.\nMigration Steps\ndelete config and build directories\ndelete babel.rc\nrename static to public\nmove index.html (and any other static contents) into public\ncreate an aliases.config.js file and load it with the contents specified in this document\ncreate an babel.config.js file and load it with the contents specified in this document\ncreate an vue.config.js file and load it with the contents specified in this document\ndelete docs directory as it will be recreated when you run the build\ndelete package-lock.json file - this file will get automatically recreated when you run npm install\nreplace the contents of package.json with the code contents specified in this document\ncreate a router.js file in the src of the project and move the contents of router/index.js into this file\ncreate a views directory and move any files in the components directory that are reference in the router.js into the views directory\nadd an empty .gitkeep file to the views and components directory (this is to keep them around even if empty)\nupdate links in router.js to point to files in the views directory\ndelete node_module and npm install to get new ones\ntest code build by running npm run serve\nbuild production code into docs by running npm run build\npush branch to github git push -set -upstream origin \nyou should see your branch and master when you run git branch\nmerge to master by checking out master locally and running merge\ngit checkout master\ngit merge \nadd/commit/push migrated code to github and test on github.io\nOnce you're done merging you can delete the branch.  It's good practice for cleanup.  You'll delete it locally and remotely.\nLocal:  git branch -d \nRemote: git push origin --delete \nContents of Config Files\nbabel.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: [\n    '@vue/app'\n  ]\n}\npostcssrc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"plugins\": {\n    \"postcss-import\": {},\n    \"postcss-url\": {},\n    // to edit target browsers: use \"browserslist\" field in package.json\n    \"autoprefixer\": {}\n  }\n}\naliases.config.js\nconst path = require('path')\nfunction resolveSrc(_path) {\n  return path.join(__dirname, _path)\n}\nconst aliases = {\n  '@': 'src',\n  '@src': 'src'\n}\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpack: {},\n  jest: {}\n}\nfor (const alias in aliases) {\n  module.exports.webpack[alias] = resolveSrc(aliases[alias])\n  module.exports.jest['^' + alias + '/(.*)$'] =\n    '/' + aliases[alias] + '/$1'\n}\nvue.config.js\nconst path = require('path');\nmodule.exports = {\n    configureWebpack: {\n        resolve: {\n            //allow for @ or @src alias for src\n            alias: require('./aliases.config').webpack\n        }\n    },\n    chainWebpack: config => {\n        //turn off elint for webpack transpile\n        config.module.rules.delete('eslint');\n    },\n    runtimeCompiler: true,\n    css: {\n        sourceMap: true\n    },\n    publicPath: '',\n    //build for docs folder to enable gh-pages hosting\n    outputDir: './docs/',\n    assetsDir: 'assets'\n}\npackage.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"hello-world\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"serve\": \"vue-cli-service serve\",\n    \"build\": \"vue-cli-service build\",\n    \"lint\": \"vue-cli-service lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"axios\": \"^0.18.0\",\n    \"vue\": \"^2.5.21\",\n    \"vue-router\": \"^3.0.2\",\n    \"vue2-animate\": \"^2.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-babel\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@vue/cli-plugin-eslint\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"@vue/cli-service\": \"^3.3.0\",\n    \"babel-eslint\": \"^10.0.1\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^5.8.0\",\n    \"eslint-plugin-vue\": \"^5.0.0\",\n    \"vue-template-compiler\": \"^2.5.21\"\n  },\n  \"eslintConfig\": {\n    \"root\": true,\n    \"env\": {\n      \"node\": true\n    },\n    \"extends\": [\n      \"plugin:vue/essential\",\n      \"eslint:recommended\"\n    ],\n    \"rules\": {},\n    \"parserOptions\": {\n      \"parser\": \"babel-eslint\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"postcss\": {\n    \"plugins\": {\n      \"autoprefixer\": {}\n    }\n  },\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"> 1%\",\n    \"last 2 versions\",\n    \"not ie "},"user-science-journal-setup.html":{"url":"user-science-journal-setup.html","title":"User Science Journal Setup","keywords":"","body":"This is the answer to \"How to set up a User Science Journal?\"\nUser Science Journal Setup\nYou can use any online static website for your User Science Journal.  These instructions will walk you through using a modified Bootstrap Template (Clean Blog) to create your own journal and add Google Analytics tracking to it.  We won't officially start studying Google Analytics until the second half of the quarter, but by installing this now your Journal website can become a source of data.\nDownload the User Science Blog Repository\nYou can download the User Science Journal repository from the suwebdev account on github. There is no need to fork this repo as you don't need the history and you'll be creating a repo into your own account to push it to.\n\nOnce this zip file is downloaded, you can unzip it and copy it into your project directory. Open the the directory on your IDE and then preview in your browser.  You'll be adding blog post content to the  postX.html files in the repo.  At a minimum you'll need to do some customization such has changing Jane Student to your name, but you're encourage to really personalize this repo.  This means you can add images and CSS as you wish.\nThere are 4 content files in the repo to start with:\n\nindex.html\nabout.html\npost1.html\nREADME.md\n\nYou'll put your User Sciences notes and images in the postX.html files.  When you want to create a new one, just copy and exiting one and update the active link.  You can add some markdown notes to the README to describe what you're doing in this website.\nYou can deploy to github.io with and with your DNS name, you'll be able to share what you have learned about User Science.\n\nPush the Downloaded Repo to Your Account\nCreate an new repo on github.com. You don't need to provide a license or a README.md file. Be sure it's Public.\n\nGithub.com will then give you instruction for pushing your local directory up to the repo.  These are the instructions you need to follow:\ngit init\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:rebeccapeltz/user-science-journal.git\ngit push -u origin master\nOnce your repo is in github, you  can set up github.io service and then you'll share the link to a postX.html file each week for your home assignment.\nThe link to the user science journal just created is: https://www.beckypeltz.me/user-science-journal/\nAdd Google Analytics to Each Page in the Journal\nGet a Google account if you don't already have one.\nStart using Google Analytics from the marketing platform: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\nThe first time you made need to press on the Start for Free button.\n\nOnce signed in, you'll go to the home page.

Notice that I have chose https:// because I indicated that I was using https when I set up gh-pages on github.\n\nAt the bottom of the Create Property form click on Get Tracking Code. This will create the property and take you to a screen where you can see your GA Tracking code.  You'll first have to accept terms of service.\n\nThe Tracking Code is a string that links your web page to google analytics data.  The Tracking Code is added to the page by inserting some JavaScript on to each page your want tracked.  You'll copy the code from the Tracking Code page into your butter and past it into the web page as the first item under the  tag.
