create an account on Github at https://github.com/.\nDownload and Install Git\nhttps://git-scm.com/downloads\nThis will install a Folder with a number of file and programs.\nOpen a bash window (terminal on Mac or 'git bash' on Windows) and type in\ngit --version\nThis should return a confirmation that git is installed with a version number.\nConnect to your local workstation to Github with SSH\nWithout SSH connection setup you will have to enter your username and password every time you connect to Github, which you will usually have to do during a git push  command.  By sharing your workstation public key with Github, you will not have to provided username and password to connect.\nOpen a bash session (terminal on Mac or 'git bash' on Windows).  All commands below should be entered into the bash session.\nCheck to see if you already have a private key/public key setup by listing any files in the hidden direction .ssh.\nls -al ~/.ssh\nIf you don't see any of the following files you will need to create  the key files\n\nid_rsa.pub\nid_ecdsa.pub\nid_ed25519.pub\n\nCreate public key/private key files if they don't already exist\nYou only need to do this step if you don't already have public/private key files.\nYou ll first create the key files using the email you provided to Github.  This will label the keys with that  email.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nNext you'll be prompted to enter a file name for your keys and you can just press enter to accept the default.\nEnter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]\nFinally, you'll be prompted to enter a passphrase.  This is a security feature and you will have to enter this passphrase when you connect to Github, so be sure to remember it.  It can be as simple as a four digit pin number.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]\nEnter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]\nStart SSH Agent and Add Keys\nThe SSH Agent is a process that will allow you to manage SSH Keys.  You'll start that process and add your keys with the following command.\neval $(ssh-agent -s)\nYou will see a response like this indicate that the process is running.\nAgent pid 59566\nThe command below adds your key to the ssh agent.  If the name of your key is different replace id_rsa with the name of your key.\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nAdd the SSH Key to you Github Acccount\nNow you need to add the public key to your Github account.  This will allow Github to decrypt the data you send it via SSH.\nWe start by using the clip command to copy the content of the public key SSH file to your local buffer.\nclip \nIf the clip command is not installed you can list the file to the console and then copy the contents into your buffer with ctrl-c/cmd-c.  The cat command will list the file to the console.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nYou can also open the file with a text editor and copy the content into the buffer if you have trouble with the clip command.\nNext, go to your Github account online and click on your photo.  This will reveal a dropdown selection where you should select Settings.\n\nThe Setings menu will appear on the left of the screen and from there you will click on SSH and GPG keys.\n\nAfter you click on SSH and GPG keys you, you will you click on a button to add a new key.\n\nClick on the Green button to add the key you have in you buffer.  You should see a form. Enter a Title that help you to remember the workstation you got the key from and then paste the key into the key textarea.  Finally click on the Add SSH key to add it to the list of keys known to Github.\n\nUpdate User Name and Email in Local Git Config\nThe local Git program maintains configuration data about you that should correspond to your account on github.com.  You'll want to provide the email and user name that you used for github.com in when you execute the following commands.\ngit config --global user.name \"Mona Lisa\"\ngit config --global user.email \"email@example.com\"\nYou can execute these commands to verify that you have set up the config variables properly.\ngit config --global user.name\ngit config --global user.email\nMaking VS Code the Default Editor for Git\nYou can make Visual Studio Code the default editor for git.  If you ever forget to close the quotes when adding the message during commit (git commit -m\"update) you find that git open up the default editor.\nBefore running the git config to set VS Code as the default editor, check that the application is in your computer's path so that it can be found.  You can check this by going to the command line and running.\ncode --help\nIf a list of help topic is printed to the screen, the VS Code is in the path.  If not investigate how to get VS Code into the Path.  If in the path execute the following in the command line.\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\ntest with this: git config --global -e\nIf you set up, the command above will open the .gitconfig file which is where git stores its config variable in VS Code.\nSee the answer to a question about this on Stack Overflow for more information: Editor For Git]\nHow to Use Visual Studio Code as Default Editor For Git\nAdding VS Code to your computer Path\nMac: Select\n\nMac: Shell Command: Install 'Code' command in path\nfrom the Command Palette.\nWindows: Make sure you selected\nAdd to PATH\nduring the installation.\nLinux: Make sure you installed Code via our new .deb or .rpm packages.\n\nAdditional References\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/\n"},"second-question.html":{"url":"second-question.html","title":"Setup Dev environment with Visual Studio Code","keywords":"","body":"This is the answer to \"How to set up Dev environment with Visual Studio Code?\".\nInstall Visual Studio Code\nDownload and install VS Code using the link below.\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/\nPlugins\nPlugins provide additional functionality.\nLive-Server plugin\nLive-Server will serve up web pages from your VS Code project to your default browser.  It runs an HTTP server as a background process on the 5500 port, which is a development port.\nTo install:\nClick on the Extensions icon located at the bottom of the left nav bar in the VS Code Application.\n\nSearch for 'Live-Server' and click on the Green Install button.\n\nAfter the Extension is loaded, click on the Blue Reload button to complete the installation.\n\nNow you should see a Go Live button in the bottom status bar.  When you click on that, Live-Server will start and serve your index.html  file by default.\nOnce the server has been started, the Go Live button will change to Port: 5500 which indicates that the server is running. The Go Live and Port:5500 buttons operate as a toggle. When you save changes in files that are being served, the server will automatically reserve the files. This will ensure that your browser is always running the latest saved changes.\n\nBeautify Plugin\nThe Beautify Plug in will help with code formatting.  It will allow you to right-click on a document that you are editing and see a \"Format Document\" option.  Clicking on this will format your page.  As with all VS Code plugin installs, you go navigate to the plugin section, search for the plugin you want to install, press the Install button and then press the Reload button to make the plugin active.\nThe picture below shows the install button.\n\nThe picture below shows the Format Document option that you see when you right click in a document.\n\nUser Settings\nVS Code allows you to customize settings for all projects (User Settings) or for a single project (Workspace settings). VS Code provides a GUI settings manager by default. To modify default settings by upgrading JSON configuration directly use the open command (CTRL-Shift-P on Windows or CMD-Shift-P on Mac) and type in \"Open Settins (JSON)\".   \n \nYou will see 2 files side by side.  On the left are the default settings and on the right are the User setting overrides.\n\nTo change a default setting find the setting on the left and then copy it to the right with your desired setting.  For example, if you don't want to see the minimap on the right hand side of the application, you can make the following entry in the file on the right. Notice that options are key : value pairs and that they are commas separated.\n{\n\"editor.minimap.enabled\":false\n}\nIf you are using Windows and want to use \"Git Bash\" in for the VS Code terminal add the following to your User Settings:\n\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\"\nHow to Easily Add VS Code to the Mac PATH\nIt is often handy to be able to open VS Code from the command line.  In order to do this the \"code\" command which is the name of the VS Code program must be in the machine's list of programs which are stored in the environmental PATH variable.

One way to set up Github hosting is to create a gh-pages branch in your repo.  Any code in that branch will be hosted at an address that follows this pattern\nhttps://.github.io/\nFor example if my account name is janedev and my repo name is wats3010-hello-world , and I have created a gh-pages branch on my repo, I will find the index.html located in the root of the repo served up at this URL:\nhttps://janedev.github.io/wats3010-hello-world\nIf you have created a gh-pages branch, but are unsure where it is hosted you can click on the Settings tab on the main page of your repo and then scroll down to find the link to the hosted web pages.\n\nCommands to create gh-pages\nWhen you start working on a new repo you will be in the master branch.\nFrom a bash terminal (git bash on Window or terminal on Mac)\nCheck which branch you're in\ngit status\nIf you are in master and you want to create a gh-pages branch on Github enter the following commands.\nFirst push all your work to master.  You can add a single file or all files.

Specifiy gh-pages:gh-pages tells github that the branch is named gh-pages locally and remotely.  The format is local:remote.\ngit push -u origin gh-pages:gh-pages\nCommands to continue work on gh-pages branch\nIf you are returning to work on code in a repo that you have worked on before, you will not need to run checkout -b because you don't want to create a new branch, you just want to access the existing branch.  Start with getting status.\ngit status\nIf the status indicates that you are already on gh-pages, you don't have to do anything.  If you're on master, you can checkout gh-pages.

An SSH connection allows you to connects one node(machine) in a network to another without have to to enter a password.   The relationship between the two machines will follow a client server model.  The machine on which you type \"ssh @client (aka \"local machine\") an the machine that you are trying to connect to is the server (aka \"host machine\").  The server always maintains the information about the username and password.   A machine may act as either client or server depending on whether the user is logged on to it or trying to connect ot it: if the user is already logged on to it, it is the client.\nIn order for a client to connect to a server using SSH, it must set up a  public key/private key pair.  The public key and private key provide the encryption needed for secure authentication and authorization.  An algorithm can verify that a give private key matches a given public key.  Both the public and private keys are stored on the client.  Before the client can connect to the server, the server must record the public key of the client in an file called authorized_keys located in the .ssh directory under the home directory of the user on the server machine.  When the user issues the SSH command from the client machine the public key (and proof that it has the matching private key) is sent to the server.  If there is a match between the public key sent to the server and one of the keys in the authorized_keys file, then a test is made on the client to see if the server is trusted. During ssh initialization the host send the client a host key.  The client checks the host key against entries in the known_hosts file.  If the host key is not found a message pops up asking the user to verify the host.  Once verified the host key is added to the client's known_hosts file.\nFor example if I want to issue the following command:  ssh bob@1.2.3.4, the following setup must exist on the the client and server machines.\n\nYou can think of authorized_keys as a file that helps the server trust the client and known_hosts as a  file that helps the client trust the server.  The public key, authorized_keys and known_hosts files are all text files and the contents may be safely copy and pasted.  It is also possible to add a config file to the client .ssh directory and the config file can be used to map servers to different public/private key files if needed.  In general, SSH will look in the .ssh directory and try all keys if needed when attempted to authenticate.\nA machine may contain both and authorized_keys file and a known_hosts  file because it can be operating in the either role at different times.\n \nSetting up SSH on a Mac or Linux Client\nCheck to see if key files already exist because you don't want to replace them if they might already be in use.\nls -la ~/.ssh/\nLook for id_rsa_ _and id_rsa.pub\nGenerate the key files\nssh-keygen\nCheck that the key files have been properly generated\nls -la ~/.ssh/\nCopy the public key to the buffer\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nSelect contents of file from screen and CTRL-c to put in buffer\nUse a text editor and paste the key into the authorized_keys file on the server you wish to access.\nSetting up SSH on a Windows Client\nIf you are using Windows 10, you have 3 options for creating the public/private key needed for SSH and running SSH.\n\nUse git bash to create keys and run SSH. When you download git to you windows machine, you will get the git bash program which will provide a bash interface.  See this article on github.com: https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/.\nUse puTTYgen to create the public and private keys.  Use puTTY to create an SSH Session from a GUI.  See this youtube video for an example of how to use puTTY to connect to a server.\nInstall a linux shell on your Windows 10 machine. This will create a new file system, so you need to keep this in mind if you're developing on the Windows file system.

Sometimes these will fail due to inadequate permissions granted to directories and files that the update process needs to do its job.\nYou can view Unix permissions for each file and directory by running ls -la.  The output will resemble what is shown below:\n\nUnix assigns Read (r), Write (w),and Execute (x) permissions to each object and directory objects have a (d) in front of the permission string.

See this website, permissions-calculator, to see how changing the octal value changes the value of the read, write, execute properties.\nThe chmod command allows you to change the permissions on an object.  If I want to enable all permission on a object I could issue the command chmod 777 .   In order to allow Wordpress to successfully update I used chmod 775 on the following directories and files under the Wordpress installation.  You should cd to /var/www/html before you execute these commands.\n\nchmod 775 wp-content\nchmod 775 wp-admin/includes\nchmod 775 wp-admin\nchmod 775 wp-includes\nchmod 775 wp-login.php\nchmod 775 wp-activate.php\nchmod 775 wp-signup.php \nchmod 775 wp-comments-post.php\nchmod 775 wp-comments-post.php\n\nIf you wanted to \"loosen\" permissions on everything - all files and directories - under a given directory the command is:\nchmod -R  775 html\nThe -R means recursively apply the 775 to all files and directories under the html directory.  For example, if you find you still can't install with the directed chmod command above, you can navigate to the directory above the server root and then set all files and directories under the server root to allow the user to write with the following commands:\ncd /var/www\nchmod -R 775 html\nWhen adding permissions to any application, such as Wordpress, you alway want to give just enough but not to much access.

Here's an example if your IP address is  203.0.113.0 \nssh root@203.0.113.0\nIf your using a Mac you can do this from the terminal and if you're using Windows, I recommend doing it from Git Bash.\nCreate droplet\nConnect with SSH\n"}}}
