# Git Command Line

This is not an all inclusive document on how to use the Git Command Line.  This a quick reference on the command to clone a repo from Github.com and then push changes back to Github.com.

I'm am using a repo, **wats3010-hello-world** from my account, **rebeccapeltz**, on [Github.com](https://www.github.com) to demonstrate these commands. 

## Copy the ssh git address of your repo into your clipboard

The picture below shows that I have clicked on the green button \(see green arrow in picture\) labeled **Clone or Download**.  I have also clicked on the link labeled "**Use SSH**" \(see blue arrow in the picture\).  I see an address **git@github.com:rebeccapeltz/wats3010-** and I have clicked on the **copy icon** to  copy this address into my clipboard \(see yellow arrow in the picture\).
